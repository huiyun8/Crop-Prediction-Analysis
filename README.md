# Crop-Prediction-Analysis
Precision agriculture has gained immense popularity in recent years, as it enables farmers to make well-informed decisions about their farming strategies. In this context, crop prediction analysis has emerged as a crucial aspect of precision agriculture. To address this, a crop prediction analysis project was undertaken using a dataset sourced from Kaggle. The dataset was developed by augmenting datasets of rainfall, climate, and fertilizer information that are accessible in India. It comprises of seven feature columns, namely N, P, K, temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall, along with one label column named "label," which includes 22 categories of crops. The dataset contains a total of 2201 rows and forms the basis of the analysis.

To compare and determine the best crop to cultivate based on given features, 6 different models have been implemented.
